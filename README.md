# House Price Prediction ML Project Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the House Price Prediction Machine Learning (ML) project. The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. 

## Project Structure
- **Dataset**: Description of the dataset used for training and testing the ML models.
- **Preprocessing**: Steps taken to preprocess the data before feeding it into the ML models.
- **Model Selection**: Overview of the different ML models experimented with and rationale for choosing the final model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the ML models.
- **Deployment**: Discussion on how the final model is deployed for real-world use.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [name of the dataset], which contains [number of samples] samples and [number of features] features. The features include [list of features]. The target variable is [target variable].

## Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**: Any missing or inconsistent data is handled by [method].
2. **Feature Engineering**: New features are created from existing ones, such as [example].
3. **Normalization/Scaling**: Features are scaled using [method] to ensure they have similar ranges.

## Model Selection
Several ML models were experimented with, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

The final model selected is [model name] because [reason for selection, e.g., best performance on validation set].

## Model Evaluation
Evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the model include:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R2)

The final model achieved the following performance on the test set:
- MAE: [value]
- MSE: [value]
- RMSE: [value]
- R2: [value]

## Deployment
The final model is deployed using [deployment method, e.g., Flask API] and can be accessed at [endpoint]. Users can input house features and receive a predicted price.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of developing a house price prediction ML model from data preprocessing to model deployment. Further improvements could include [potential improvements, e.g., incorporating additional features, fine-tuning hyperparameters].
